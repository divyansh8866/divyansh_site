You can then run the following command to install the Serverless Framework CLI: npminstall-gserverless Set up your AWS credentials: To use the Serverless Framework with AWS, you will need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by running the following command: serverlessconfigcredentials--provideraws--keyYOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY--secretYOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY Create a new serverless application: To create a new serverless application, you can run the serverless create command and specify the name of your application and the cloud provider you want to use. For example: serverlesscreate--templateaws-nodejs--pathmy-app This will create a new directory called my-app that contains the basic structure of a serverless application, including a configuration file (serverless.yml) and a sample function (handler.js). Define your functions and events: Next, you will need to define your functions and the events that trigger them in the serverless.yml configuration file. This file is written in YAML and specifies all of the different components of your serverless application, including the functions, events, and resources needed by the application. Here is an example of a simple function that is triggered by an HTTP request: functions:hello:handler:handler.helloevents:- http:path:/method:get This function is defined in the handler.js file and is triggered by an HTTP GET request to the root path (/). Deploy your application: Once you have defined your functions and events, you can deploy your application to AWS by running the serverless deploy command. This will create all of the necessary resources in AWS and deploy your code to the cloud. serverlessdeploy That’s it! You should now have a working serverless application on AWS. You can test your function by sending an HTTP request to the URL provided by the Serverless Framework after the deployment is complete.

Tables The metadata definition for the data in a data store is a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. You can manually create a table in the AWS Glue console or generate a table when you run a crawler. The values of your table’s metadata are shown in the Tables list in the AWS Glue console. When you develop ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs, you use table definitions to identify sources and targets.

AWS is powerfull tool as it is based on distrubuted framework. AWS Glue consists of three major components as shown below. Meta Data Repository : Meta data repo will not store raw datas in it but instead it stores schema and other metadata related to the structure of data which is stored in Databases such as S3, DynamoDB etc. For example : ETL Engine : ETL engine is used for Extracting data from a source and perform different types of transform function on data and finaly load data into data warehouse or any database as per preferance.

I’ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Today, I’m working from home as a software developer for JobTarget, Inc., and I get to show off all these elements of who I am. I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. After a college education in Engineering, and continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized Computer Science was the right field for me. Since then, I’ve worked on countless freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups. Today, I’m working as a junior developer with the amazing team at JobTarget, Inc., and am getting into Cloud and data science on my own time. I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Python, C, C++, SQL, AWS, Serverless Framework but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
