Tables The metadata definition for the data in a data store is a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. You can manually create a table in the AWS Glue console or generate a table when you run a crawler. The values of your table’s metadata are shown in the Tables list in the AWS Glue console. When you develop ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs, you use table definitions to identify sources and targets.

AWS is powerfull tool as it is based on distrubuted framework. AWS Glue consists of three major components as shown below. Meta Data Repository : Meta data repo will not store raw datas in it but instead it stores schema and other metadata related to the structure of data which is stored in Databases such as S3, DynamoDB etc. For example : ETL Engine : ETL engine is used for Extracting data from a source and perform different types of transform function on data and finaly load data into data warehouse or any database as per preferance. Flexible scheduler : This allows ETL jobs to be scheduled on CRON.

I’ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Today, I’m working from home as a software developer for JobTarget, Inc., and I get to show off all these elements of who I am. I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. After a college education in Engineering, and continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized Computer Science was the right field for me. Since then, I’ve worked on countless freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups. Today, I’m working as a junior developer with the amazing team at JobTarget, Inc., and am getting into Cloud and data science on my own time. I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Python, C, C++, SQL, AWS, Serverless Framework but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
